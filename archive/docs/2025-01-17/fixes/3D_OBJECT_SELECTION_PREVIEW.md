# 3D Object Selection Preview - Unified Workflow Tracking

## Date: 2025-06-14

## Overview
The "3D OBJECT SELECTION" panel in the left sidebar now provides a unified view of selected objects throughout the entire workflow, from image selection to Cinema4D import.

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Object Tracking
- Each selection represents ONE object that evolves through different states
- An object that starts as an image and becomes a 3D model shows as a single entry
- The status icon updates to reflect the current state: 🖼️ → 📦 → 🎨

### 2. Status Icons
- 🖼️ **Image**: Selected source image waiting for 3D generation
- 📦 **3D Model**: Generated 3D model ready for texturing
- 🎨 **Textured**: 3D model with applied textures ready for Cinema4D
- ●→● **Progress Indicator**: Shows when an object has progressed from image to model

### 3. Intelligent Object Linking
When a 3D model is generated from a selected image:
- The system recognizes they are the same object
- Shows as a single entry with updated status (not two separate entries)
- Both the image and model remain selected internally for proper tracking
- The preview shows the most advanced state (model over image)

### 4. Workflow Hints
The preview shows contextual hints based on current selection:
- "→ Generate 3D models" - when images are selected
- "→ Apply textures" - when untextured models are selected  
- "→ Import to Cinema4D" - when textured models are selected

## Implementation Details

### Selection Tracking
```python
# Three types of selections are tracked:
self.selected_images = []     # Selected source images
self.selected_models = []     # Selected 3D models
self.textured_models = set()  # Models that have been textured
```

### Preview Update Logic
1. Creates a unified object map using image paths as base identifiers
2. Links generated models to their source images using associations
3. Shows each object only once at its most advanced state
4. Updates automatically when:
   - Images are selected/deselected
   - Models are generated from images
   - Models are selected/deselected
   - Textures are applied to models

### Texture Detection
Models are marked as textured when:
1. Texture generation workflow completes successfully
2. Texture files are found matching the model name pattern:
   - `{model}_diffuse.*`
   - `{model}_albedo.*`
   - `{model}_texture.*`
   - `{model}_color.*`
   - `{model}.png/jpg/jpeg`

## User Experience
1. Select images in Image Generation tab
2. See them appear in "3D OBJECT SELECTION" as 🖼️ Images
3. Generate 3D models - selection automatically updates to show 📦 3D Models
4. Apply textures - selection updates to show 🎨 Textured models
5. Import to Cinema4D with full tracking of what's selected

## Benefits
- **Clear Workflow Visibility**: Always know what's selected and its current state
- **No Duplicate Confusion**: Images automatically replaced by their generated models
- **Progressive Enhancement**: See objects evolve through the pipeline
- **Contextual Guidance**: Hints show what to do next
