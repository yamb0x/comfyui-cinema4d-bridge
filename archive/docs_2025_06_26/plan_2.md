# Plan #2: Complete Texture Generation Tab Implementation - Detailed Requirements

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the texture generation tab from basic UI to a fully functional texture creation and management system, completing the Image → 3D → Texture → Cinema4D pipeline.

## 📋 Detailed Requirements

### 2.1 Cross-Tab Model Selection System

**Current State:**
- Model selection doesn't properly propagate between Image Generation → 3D Generation → Texture Generation
- Multiple selection sources not properly unified
- Selection state lost when switching tabs

**Required Implementation:**
```python
# Selection Sources to Unify:
# 1. self.selected_models (main tracking list)
# 2. model_grid.get_selected_models() (View All tab)  
# 3. scene_objects_slots (Scene Objects tab)
# 4. 3D generation results (newly generated models)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generated 3D models automatically available for texture generation
- Manual model selection works across all tabs
- Selection state persists when switching between tabs
- Clear indication of selected models in texture tab

### 2.2 Workflow Execution & Monitoring

**Current State:**
- Texture generation workflows exist but execution is incomplete
- No proper workflow completion monitoring
- Node compatibility issues similar to early 3D generation problems

**Required Implementation:**
Apply proven workflow completion pattern:

```python
# 1. Node Conversion (from workflow_manager.py)
if node_data.get("class_type") == "Image Save":
    node_data["class_type"] = "SaveImage"
    
# 2. Completion Monitoring (from _start_workflow_completion_monitoring)
def _start_texture_workflow_monitoring(prompt_id, batch_size):
    # Use ComfyUI history API instead of file monitoring
    # Download textures via comfyui_client.fetch_image()
    # Save to textured_models_dir with proper naming
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Texture generation workflows execute successfully
- Progress monitoring shows real-time status
- Failed generations provide clear error messages
- Generated textures are automatically downloaded and saved

### 2.3 Texture Result Handling

**Current State:**
- No system for handling generated texture results
- Missing integration with file system and UI
- No preview or management capabilities

**Required Implementation:**

**File Management:**
- Save textured models to `config.textured_models_dir`
- Use consistent naming: `textured_model_{source_image_name}_{timestamp}.obj`
- Include associated texture files (.mtl, .png/.jpg)

**UI Integration:**
- Display textured models in dedicated preview area
- Show before/after comparison (original 3D model vs textured)
- Provide management actions (delete, rename, export)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generated textures appear in UI automatically
- Before/after comparison available for quality assessment
- File management operations work correctly
- Texture files properly associated with 3D models

### 2.4 3D Viewer Integration

**Current State:**
- 3D viewer exists (`src/ui/viewers/threejs_3d_viewer.py`) but not integrated
- No texture display capabilities in main application
- Missing preview functionality for textured models

**Required Implementation:**

**Viewer Integration:**
```python
# Add to texture tab UI
self.texture_viewer = ThreeJS3DViewer(
    show_controls=True,
    show_wireframe_toggle=True,
    show_texture_toggle=True  # New feature
)
```

**Texture Display Features:**
- Toggle between textured and untextured models
- Multiple texture maps support (diffuse, normal, roughness)
- Lighting controls for texture evaluation
- Export functionality for textured models

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 3D viewer properly displays textured models
- Texture toggling works smoothly
- Performance remains acceptable with complex textures
- Export functionality preserves texture mapping

### 2.5 Enhanced File Monitoring

**Current State:**
- File monitor updated in current session to use config paths
- Need to ensure textured model detection works correctly
- Integration with texture workflow results

**Required Implementation:**

**Monitoring Setup:**
- Watch `config.textured_models_dir` for new .obj files
- Detect associated texture files (.mtl, image files)
- Auto-load textured models into UI on detection
- Handle file locking during generation process

**File Detection Logic:**
```python
# Pattern matching for textured models
textured_model_pattern = r"textured_model_(.+)_(\d+)\.(obj|fbx|gltf)"

# Associated file detection
def find_associated_files(model_path):
    # Find .mtl material files
    # Find texture image files
    # Validate complete texture set
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New textured models automatically appear in UI
- Complete texture sets (model + materials + images) properly detected
- No false positives from temporary or incomplete files
- Performance remains good with large numbers of files

## 🚨 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk: Workflow Compatibility

### Medium Risk: Performance with Large Textures
- **Risk**: Large texture files may impact viewer performance
- **Mitigation**: Implement progressive loading and texture compression

### Low Risk: File System Integration
- **Risk**: File monitoring may miss rapid generations
- **Mitigation**: Use robust file detection with retries
- **Fallback**: Manual refresh option for users
