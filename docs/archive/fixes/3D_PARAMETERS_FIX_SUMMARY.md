# 3D Parameters Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Parameters Not Loading in Right Panel
The 3D parameters configuration was being saved but not displayed in the right panel UI. This has been fixed by ensuring the `_refresh_3d_parameters_ui()` method is called after configuration is saved.

### 2. Missing Required Inputs for ComfyUI Nodes
The workflow validation was failing because many 3D-specific node types weren't handled in the workflow conversion. Added support for:

#### New Node Types in Workflow Conversion:
- `ImageResize+`: Advanced image resizing with width, height, interpolation, method, condition, multiple_of
- `ImageScaleBy`: Image scaling with upscale_method, scale_by
- `Hy3DRenderMultiView`: Multi-view rendering with render_size, texture_size  
- `Hy3DCameraConfig`: Camera setup with camera_distance, ortho_scale, camera_elevations, camera_azimuths, view_weights
- `UpscaleModelLoader`: Model loading with model_name
- `DownloadAndLoadHy3DPaintModel`: Paint model with model parameter
- `Hy3DSampleMultiView`: Multi-view sampling with seed, steps, view_size
- `CV2InpaintTexture`: Texture inpainting with inpaint_radius, inpaint_method

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Manager Updates (`workflow_manager.py`)
1. Added widget_values to inputs conversion for all new node types in `_convert_ui_to_api_format()`
2. Added parameter injection for both UI and API formats in:
   - `_inject_params_3d_ui_format()` 
   - `_inject_params_3d_api_format()`

### UI Updates (`app.py`)
1. Added dynamic UI parameter collection in `_collect_3d_parameters()` to check for dynamic params first
2. Added new parameter helper methods:
   - `_add_3d_render_params()` for Hy3DRenderMultiView
   - `_add_3d_camera_params()` for Hy3DCameraConfig  
   - `_add_3d_sample_params()` for Hy3DSampleMultiView

### Configuration Dialog Updates (`configure_3d_parameters_dialog.py`)
1. Added all new node types to `SUPPORTED_NODE_TYPES` dictionary
2. Nodes now properly appear in the selection tree when loading workflows

## Usage Flow
1. User goes to File > Configure 3D Generation Parameters
2. Loads the UV workflow JSON file
3. Selects which nodes to expose parameters for
4. Saves configuration
5. Parameters now appear in right panel with proper controls
6. When Generate 3D is clicked, all parameters are collected and injected into workflow
7. ComfyUI receives properly formatted workflow with all required inputs
